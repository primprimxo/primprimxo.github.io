        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>Prim’s Bakery is a family-owned panadería rooted in the heart of Michoacán, inspired by traditional flavors and modern sweetness. What began as a small home kitchen project has grown into a warm neighborhood bakery where everything is made fresh daily.</p>

        <p>Our pastries blend classic Mexican recipes with contemporary techniques. From conchas with delicate crumb to tarts filled with seasonal fruits, our goal is to create treats that feel both nostalgic and new.</p>

        <p>We believe in craftsmanship—slow baking, quality ingredients, and attention to detail. Each pastry, drink, and cup of coffee is made with care and intention.</p>

        <p>Above all, Prim’s Bakery is about community. We welcome locals and travelers to share a moment of sweetness with us and experience the joy of good bread.</p>
